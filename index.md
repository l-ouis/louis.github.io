Hi! I'm currently a student at Brown University studying Computer Science and Applied Math.

I love:

- building software & crafting algorithms,
- all things music, and
- any games and puzzles

<br />

### Experiences & Projects

**Software Engineering Intern at SpaceX**

Developing software to parallelize factory-wide lineside production and writing algorithms that take messy [RFID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification){:target="_blank"} data and produce reliable, location-tagged inventory counts.

**Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Brown University**

Our eyes and vision are one of the main ways of interacting with the web, but there is barely any software out there that takes advantage of it for the individual user. At Brown HCI, I'm studying how web behavior summaries created with local eye-tracking software affects user task resumption.

Also developing and maintaining [WebGazer](https://github.com/brownhci/webgazer){:target="_blank"}, a webcam eyetracker that updates predictions using user interactions (don't worry, it all runs locally).

**DDNet**

[DDNet](https://ddnet.org/){:target="_blank"} is one of the world's largest multiplayer open-source games. I've:

- Placed first in an official [tournament](https://ddnet.org/tournaments/7event4/){:target="_blank"}

- Created [maps](https://ddnet.org/mappers/louis/){:target="_blank"} (the levels players actually play), including the [most-finished map in the entire network](https://ddnet.org/maps/Linear){:target="_blank"}

- Contributed code to the [official repository](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet){:target="_blank"}

I'm also on the staff team (map testing & managing the skin database).


**24cast.org**

Developed first open-source reactive, scalable [election portal](https://github.com/BPR-Data-Team){:target="_blank"}. Served as on-call developer at Brown Political Review's live 2024 election event and got to fix a few critical bugs!



### Other Stuff

**Typing**

298th place on the global monkeytype.com 60s leaderboards (190wpm, top 0.1%). Also a huge fan of blank keycaps.

**Games**

Working on Arcitect, a bullet-hell builder with an advanced enemy behavior editor.
