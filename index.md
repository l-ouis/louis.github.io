Hi! I'm currently a student at Brown University studying Computer Science and Applied Math.

I love:

- building software & writing algorithms,
- listening to & producing music, and
- all things games and puzzles

<br />

### Experiences & Projects

**Software Engineering Intern at SpaceX**

Developing software to parallelize factory-wide lineside production and writing algorithms that take messy [RFID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification){:target="_blank"} data and produce reliable, location-tagged inventory counts.

**E-GLAMOUR Lab at Brown University**

Researching theoretical and computational problems in game theory, optimization, and machine learning. Reinforcement learning combines CS and mathematics in a really cool way and really feels like magic.

**Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Brown University**

Our eyes and vision are one of the main ways of interacting with the web, but there is barely any software out there that takes advantage of it for the individual user. At Brown HCI, I'm studying how web behavior summaries created with local eye-tracking software affects user task resumption.

Also developing and maintaining [WebGazer](https://github.com/brownhci/webgazer){:target="_blank"}, a webcam eyetracker that updates predictions using user interactions (don't worry, it all runs locally).

**DDNet**

[DDNet](https://ddnet.org/){:target="_blank"} is one of the world's largest multiplayer open-source games. I've:

- Placed first in an official [tournament](https://ddnet.org/tournaments/7event4/){:target="_blank"}

- Created [maps](https://ddnet.org/mappers/louis/){:target="_blank"} (the levels players actually play), including the [most-finished map on the entire network](https://ddnet.org/maps/Linear){:target="_blank"}

- Contributed code to the [official repository](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet){:target="_blank"}, and work on new features and bug fixes in my free time

I'm currently one of the six administrators that lead DDNet.


**24cast.org**

Developed first open-source reactive, scalable [election portal](https://github.com/BPR-Data-Team){:target="_blank"}. Served as on-call developer at Brown Political Review's live 2024 election event and got to fix a few critical bugs!



### Other Stuff

**Typing**

Top 300 global placement on monkeytype.com 60s leaderboards (note: may be out of date, I only grind every now and then)

**Games**
